# ML Platform
================

Welcome to the ML Platform repository! This repository provides a web-based environment for running Python notebooks, testing AI and Deep Learning, and supporting various Python libraries and frameworks.

## Getting Started
---------------

### Running the Platform

To run the platform, simply build the Docker image by running the following command:

```
docker build -t ml-platform
```

Then, start a new container from the image by running:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 ml-platform
```

This will start a new container and map port 8888 on the host machine to port 8888 in the container. You can then access the Jupyter Notebook interface by visiting `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser.

### Using the Platform

Once you have access to the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can create new notebooks, upload datasets, and run Python code using various libraries and frameworks. The platform comes with a few example notebooks and datasets to get you started.

## Directory Structure
---------------------

* `notebooks/`: This directory contains example notebooks for users to run.
* `data/`: This directory contains datasets for users to use in their notebooks.
* `Dockerfile`: This file contains instructions for building a Docker image for the platform.

## Contributing
------------

Contributions to the ML Platform repository are welcome! If you'd like to add new notebooks, datasets, or features to the platform, please submit a pull request.
